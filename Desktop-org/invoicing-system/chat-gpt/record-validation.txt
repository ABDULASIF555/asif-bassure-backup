Java records, introduced in Java 16, provide a concise way to declare simple classes for data storage and retrieval. They are often used to represent data transfer objects (DTOs), domain objects, and data structures. In the context of a Spring Boot application, you can use Java records to represent objects, such as request/response DTOs, without having to write a lot of boilerplate code.

Here's how you can define a Java record object in a Spring Boot application:

```java
public record Invoice(String customerName, String invoiceNumber, double amount, LocalDate invoiceDate) {
    // You can include additional methods or constructors here if needed
}
```

In this example, we've defined an `Invoice` record with four components: `customerName`, `invoiceNumber`, `amount`, and `invoiceDate`. Records automatically generate the following:

1. A constructor to initialize the components.
2. Getter methods for each component.
3. An `equals` method to compare two instances for structural equality.
4. A `hashCode` method based on the component values.
5. A `toString` method to provide a human-readable representation.

Using a record can simplify your code when you need to represent data objects like DTOs, API request/response objects, or domain objects with minimal boilerplate.

Here's an example of how you might use this `Invoice` record in a Spring Boot controller:

```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/invoices")
public class InvoiceController {
    @PostMapping
    public ResponseEntity<String> createInvoice(@RequestBody Invoice invoice) {
        // You can use the Invoice record directly in your controller method
        String customerName = invoice.customerName();
        String invoiceNumber = invoice.invoiceNumber();
        double amount = invoice.amount();
        LocalDate invoiceDate = invoice.invoiceDate();

        // Perform actions with the Invoice data

        return ResponseEntity.ok("Invoice created successfully");
    }
}
```

In this example, the `@RequestBody` annotation is used to automatically deserialize the JSON request body into an `Invoice` record, allowing you to access its components directly in your controller method.

Please note that Java records are available from Java 16 onwards, so you need to ensure that your Spring Boot application uses Java 16 or a later version if you want to use records.
